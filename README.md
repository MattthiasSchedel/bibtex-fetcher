To use the extension, simply copy the title of any paper to your clipboard and press the "Add Citation" button. The BibTex Fetcher automatically looks up the title on DBLP and Scholar Archive and adds the according BibTex to a library.bib file. 

### Generating BibTex for websites

To generate the citation for a website, simply copy the url and press the "Add Citation" Button. 
> Sometimes websites have redirects installed which prevents this plugin from fetching the title. In that case you can add the title by yourself inside of the .bib file.
